  <p>Hello world. This is my second website!</p>
  <p>My name is Amanda. I am married and have two kids. I just had knee surgery, which is why I have time to complete this course now.</p>
  <p>I have done a coding bootcamp before. It's where I created my first website. I sadly was not able to complete the bootcamp though which is why I am brushing up on my skills now and hoping it can help me land a work from home job.</p>
